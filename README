Just another cpp logger :>

Todo list:
• enlarge family of dispatchers (UDP/TCP sockets, Syslog ...)
• prefix for dispatchers
• smart time-stamp for dispatcher and loggers
• custom printf
• callbacks for custom printf
• config file for logger
• logged asserts
• respect NDEBUG to disable logging like in assert()
• iostream


Important features planned:
• thread safety
• reenter-ability
• cross-platform
• exception safety

Current features:
• thread safe logger and bility to disable thread safety during compilation of library and at runtime (for performance reasons)
• thread safe dispatcher family and ability to disable safety during compilation of library and at runtime
• several dispatchers
• one to many relation between logger and dispatchers

Something else sould be written here some day.
