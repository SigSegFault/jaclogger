Just another cpp logger :>

Todo list:
• enlarge family of dispatchers (UDP/TCP sockets, Syslog ...)
• prefix for dispatchers
• time-stamp for both
• custom printf
• callbacks for custom printf
• config
• asserts
• NDEBUG
• iostream
• thread safe dispatcher family and ability to disable safety during compilation of library and at runtime


Important features planned:
• thread safety
• ability to disable it during compilation of library and at runtime (for performance reasons)
• reenter-ability
• cross-platform
• exception safety

Current features:
• Thread safe logger
• Several dispatchers
• One to many relation between logger and dispatchers

Something else sould be written here some day.
